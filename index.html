        <section class="objective">
            <h2>Project Objective</h2>
            <p>The goal of 3D-EcoMap is to process 2D satellite images into accurate 3D models. These 3D models allow for the analysis of road slopes, which can significantly affect a vehicle's fuel consumption. By calculating the impact of these slopes, the project aims to provide drivers with the most efficient and eco-friendly routes. The project offers an ideal solution for anyone looking to reduce fuel costs and drive more sustainably.</p>
