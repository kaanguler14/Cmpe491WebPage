In todayâ€™s rapidly urbanizing world, optimizing travel routes is critical not only for cost savings but
also for reducing environmental impact. As the number of vehicles on the road continues to increase,
the urgency to reduce fuel consumption and emissions also increases. However, traditional navigation
systems often rely on 2D maps that prioritize distance and traffic conditions only, ignoring the impact
of road topography on fuel efficiency. 3D-EcoMap aims to address these issues by offering a flatter,
slightly longer route rather than a shorter route with steep slopes, which can lead to significantly more
fuel consumption. Our project offers an eco-friendly driving experience.

3D-EcoMap is an innovative navigation system designed to improve fuel efficiency and environmental
sustainability by integrating slope analysis into route optimization. The system detects road slopes by
processing 2D satellite images into 3D models. These slopes are incorporated into algorithms that
recommend the most fuel-efficient routes, helping drivers lower fuel costs and reduce their
environmental impact. This web-based application offers a user-friendly interface for 3D map
visualization, allowing users to interact with 3D models of their road routes and make eco-friendly
navigation choices.
